Exercise 2: Hierarchical transformation
-----------------------------------------

For your final assignment, you will apply the transformations you created
and the knowledge about compositions to animate a solar system.

First start the program and see what happens.
You're supposed to see one shape that resembles a planet. This is the sun.
There are also an earth and a moon, but they are currently hidden by the sun.

The goal of this assignment is to use transformation matrices to
1. Place the earth and moon in the solar system.
2. Animate the earth and moon.

First, copy your finished transformation functions.
If you have copied these and restart the program,
you should see the sun, earth and moon, since they are scaled down and translated.

After you've copied the transformation functions, scroll down to Task 1.

"""
The on_update function is called every time the screen is updated.
This happens every few milliseconds - as fast as your computer can handle.
That means you can use this function to update the solar system and animate it.

The on_update function gets three parameters:
- input: this tells the update event what happened, for example if a button has been pressed.
- dt: the change in time since the last update.
- t: the current time.

You will use the t parameter to animate your solar system.

Scroll down for the task.
