Exercise 1: Combining transformations and animation
---------------------------------------------------

Start by opening the exercise. You'll see a car on a road.
When this exercise is completed, the car will drive along the path.

The learning goal of the exercise is to get more understanding
of transformations and how you can combine them.

The following code loads all the elements in the scene:
- The car
- The road
- Arrows pointing into the x, y, z directions.

1. On a piece of paper, draw the path of the car. Don't worry about getting the distances exactly right.
   Observe what you do when you draw the path.
   What are the steps you take to turn the instructions into a drawing?
   E.g., for each element in the list, I look at the type of segment ...
2. Start the program and see if you can match the path you drew.
   We've positioned the camera in a top-view setting, so that positive x-axis points to the left
   and the negative z-axis points to the bottom of the screen.

Once you're done, continue reading the comments util you see Task 2.

The on_update function is called every time the screen is updated (every frame).
This happens every few milliseconds - as fast as your computer can handle.

The on_update function gets three parameters:
- input: this tells the update event what happened. For example, if a button has been pressed.
- dt: the change in time since the last update.
- t: the current time.

The dt parameter will tell you how much time passed since the last frame was rendered.
Using the speed defined above and dt, 
you can calculate how far the car moved since the last frame.
